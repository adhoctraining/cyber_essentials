Three logical components of IDS (i.e., sensors, analyzers, user interface).

Explain how user behavior relates to the detection of an intruder.

## Host-based (IDS). 
Describe anomaly detection, specifically threshold and profile-based approaches.

Describe the types of audit records employed in intrusion detection (i.e., native, detection-specific).

Describe signature detection, specifically rule-based anomaly and penetration identification approaches.

## Network-based (IDS)
Describe the primary approach for intrusion detection in a network.

Compare and contrast inline and passive sensors.

Discuss typical placement of sensors in a network-based IDS environment and explain the rationale for each.

Describe the operation, typical activities, and outputs of an intrusion detection system.

Describe some of the limitations of intrusion detection systems.

Differentiate between an intrusion detection system (passive) and an intrusion prevention (reactive) system.

Compare and contrast several of the intrusion detection systems available on the current market.

Describe the process of monitoring/detecting port scanning attacks and associated patterns.

Explain how the monitoring and analysis of network traffic can be used to detect intrusion.

Utilize network monitoring and analysis tools to detect intrusion and anomalies.
